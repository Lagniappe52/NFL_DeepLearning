# NFL_DeepLearning

This project involves the development of deep learning models that are designed to analyze NFL player tracking data in real time to predict offensive team strategies. The trained models are capable of classifying multiple conditions based on player positions and movements during a play. The models are currently still under development.

Prediction classifications include play type (e.g. RPO, Play Action, Pass, Run Concept), offensive formation, receiver alignment, and defensive coverage. The end goal is to provide valuable analytical information to teams who can adjust their offensive strategies during game preparation as well as real-time situations by highlighting relative team strenghts and opposing defense weaknesses.

Data was collected from the NFL Big Data Bowl 2025 Kaggle Competition at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2025

Processed data was fed to the model in json and csv formats. Player mobility data includes xy coordinates and team possession information for each game, play and frame.
